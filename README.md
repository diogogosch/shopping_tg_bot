## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding:**
- Check Telegram token validity
- Verify network connectivity
- Review application logs

**OCR accuracy issues:**
- Ensure good image quality
- Check Tesseract installation
- Consider Google Vision API for better results

**Database connection errors:**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check connection string format
- Ensure database exists and permissions are correct

**Redis connection issues:**
- Verify Redis server is running
- Check Redis URL configuration
- Monitor memory usage

### Performance Issues

**Slow response times:**
- Check database query performance
- Monitor Redis cache hit rates
- Review OCR processing times
- Optimize image preprocessing

**High memory usage:**
- Monitor image processing operations
- Check for memory leaks in long-running processes
- Optimize database query results

### Debugging

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Check database connectivity
python -c "from app.core.database import engine; print(engine.execute('SELECT 1').scalar())"

# Test Redis connection
python -c "from app.core.cache import cache; print(cache.redis_client.ping())"

# Validate OCR setup
python -c "from app.services.ocr_service import ocr_service; print('OCR ready')"
```
